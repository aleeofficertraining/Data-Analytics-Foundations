--WARM UPS: Type the following commands to build muscle memory. --
-- 1. [Grouping by one column: select state, count(id) from purchases group by state]: I would do Select * from purchases; to get a sense of the data first. 
--select distinct state from purchases p;
--select state, count (user_id) from purchases group by state;
-- 2. [Grouping by multiple columns: select state, zipcode, count(id) from purchases group by state, zipcode]: 
--select state, zipcode, count (user_id) from purchases group by state, zipcode;
--[My spinoff is that I would also order by state]: select state, zipcode, count(user_id) from purchases group by state, zipcode order by state;
-- EXERCISES: Answer using the techniques from above. --
--
--1. [Find the most recent purchase made within each state.]:
--select state, MAX (created_at) from purchases group by state;
--2. Use the purchase_items table to find the total number of each product_id sold.
