--Google Drive +New Google Colaboratory
--       If Colaboratory is not there, go to Connect More Apps. Look for Colabs and Install it.  
--      Make it the default for files you can open.
--      Now, when you go to New, you will see Google Colaboratory.      
--Change background:  Change the background which is white.  Go to Tools, Settings, Theme --> change to dark.
--Show line numbers:  Go to Tools, Settings, Editor, Show line numbers. 
--// #  hashtag or hashtag is to do commenting code
--Run a python notebook:  Use arrow - something using a play button to connect and initialize. 
--Use code:   Google Colab left shows:  +Code  +Text.   We will use Code all the time.

--Naming file:   At the top left of the screen, the file is named Untitled.ipynb.  You can click and rename to Python Basics. 
--               Press enter and the name is saved.


--Lesson 1: Create text to stay organized.  
--How do I turn code cell into regular text?

--Large header text: Type #Python basics cell into a text cell.
-- Ctrl+m m    (m twice) which turns the code cell into a large header text cell.
--It automatically subdivides the notebook into sections.

--Icons on right each cell:  After you type something, there are icons on the right side, to Add comment, edit the cell, link to cell, 
--                           delete cell.  Press control Z to undo.

--print('Hello world')  single quote.  Then Press Shift + Enter which runs the cell.
--  In Google Colab, we use parentheses ( ) and single quote.  In Chapter 1 book using Windows, the book shows no ( ), uses double quotes.

--  Shift+Enter to run the cell.

-- Data type is called String -- what is in parenthesis.
-- print('Your Name: Angela Lee')
-- print('Why Are you here: To learn python ')
-- print('Why do you want to learn Python: To code in healthcare')

--  ======================== =========================
--Python is a dynamic language.  
-- #1. Print things.
-- #2. Do Math.   
--It can bring strings in via print.  It can also calculate. 
--Mathematical operations.  Press Shift + Enter to run the cell.
--12 * 4  Press Shift+Enter and get 48.
--23 -5   Press Shift+Enter and get  18
--PAMDAS Parentheses Exponents Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction.
--% is modulus used for division

-- Table of Contents 
-- On the far left side is a column.  The first item is Table of Contents.  Variables is a new section in TOCs.
-- You can minimize your sections with the little arrow next to each section word like Variables.

-- #Variables  Press Ctrl+ m m 
--(this is Chapter 4 in the book).
--A variable is a container to hold stuff in.  Think of it literally as a bucket. 
--Python is dynamic meaning you do not have to declare a variable before you use it.  What does that mean?   You can create a bucket with a name called oranges.
--You need to give it an “assignment” which one is the equal sign.
--The word oranges is holding oranges.  To describe it you use a data type which we already use called a string.  By string, I mean in quotes oranges. 
--This container is holding a string which says this is a bunch of oranges.
--oranges = 'this is a bunch of oranges'

--To print, I don’t have to say the whole string anymore because it is in the container. So I simply say oranges. 
--print(oranges)  Press Shift+Enter and get the next line:
--this is a bunch of oranges

--Variables – the name implies that it can be changed. 
--You can change the container to be whatever you want.  

--For the variable you create,
--name it as whatever is inside the variable, or related to the variable.
--This string is a string and means absolutely nothing. 

--What does that mean?
--I call the oranges = ‘apples’ Does that make sense?  Have you ever ordered a package of oranges that has apples inside. That would be annoying and confusing.  
--A string means absolutely nothing because it’s a string.
--This time I call the variable var.  you can name it whatever you want.
--var = 3   make var equal to 3.   I will make a bunch of them.
--var2 = 5  change it to var2 = 5.7
--var3 = ‘this is another  variable’

--If I say var2.
--It can hold different types of variables.   How do we know what kind of types of a variable there are?  In Python, you can ask what type of variable it is.   Type is a built in function you do not have to install, and use it.  Since this is a method, you can say what type of variable is var.
--Type(var)  Type(var2)  Type(var3)  - int is integer, Float is decimal, str is string
--String is a sequence of characters

-- var is not capitalized
